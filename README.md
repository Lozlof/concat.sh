# concat.sh
#### Recursively scans a directory, finds all readable files, and concatenates them into a single output file 
Each file’s path and contents are appended in a Markdown-friendly format (wrapped in triple backticks).         
## Usage
```bash
./concat.sh --input /path/to/directory
```
**How I use this:**     
Easily give conext to an LLM. Instead of copy pasting individual files, concatenate all files into one.
